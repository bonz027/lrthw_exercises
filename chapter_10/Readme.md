##Rubocop errors##

changed the month strings from double quotes to single quotes.

no other errors were detected.

## Use '''instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """?##

Using single quotes instead of double quotes errors out. When I switch to single quotes it no longer recognizes the string
that was inside the double quotes.
