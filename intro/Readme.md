>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences. 

>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing - Reading the instructions or code and writing them as is, and/or getting familiar with typing the 
code out and enhance your familiarity witht he different symbols and odd characters. 

attention to detail - In my opinion the most important aspect of coding. Taking your time when writing code to assure 
that all the little details are in your code (i.e commas, and odd characters).

spotting differences - recognizing the difference between two different set of codes and immediately spotting their 
differences, mistakes, or bugs. 

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

by copy and pasting, I am robbing myself of the practice I would be getting if I were to manually type in the code. 
By manually typing out the code, I am training my eyes, brain, and hands on how to write code. 


>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Like everything else in life "practice makes perfect." The only way to ever improve your craft is to consistently work 
on it; every opportunity you get. As my coach would always say, "The difference between a professional and an amateur is
the amount of time the professional has put into practicing his craft."
