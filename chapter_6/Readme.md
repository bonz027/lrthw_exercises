The places where there are strings inside a string is in the w + e sentence, the x and y sentence, and finally the y 
sentence.

Adding the w + e makes the a longer string because it's adding the variables of both w and e one after the other which 
completes the sentence as a whole. 

When you change the strings to single quote it does not work because single quotes are used for individual characters 
and double quotes (from what I understand) is added for multiple string characters.
